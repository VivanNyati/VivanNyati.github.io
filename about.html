<p>This is a new initiative started by Dr.  Lee Hartwell, that our lab members have helped him to develop.  We are piloting this initiative at Clague Middle School. The program will consist of about 12 one hour classes with about 1 program class every two weeks.</p>

<p>The “Science of Me” is a program for middle school science designed to provide students and teachers an authentic science experience based upon an investigation of the properties of human sensory perception. Many students decide before high school that they do not want to major in STEM (Science, technology, engineering, math) subjects. They may have decided that STEM subjects are not interesting or they may have been intimated by mathematics. Other students are more interested in people than things and may find many science subjects irrelevant to their interests. Our program is designed to engage both types of students by focusing on the science of people, in particular, themselves. The program focuses on human sensory perception as the foundation of scientific inquiry.</p>
